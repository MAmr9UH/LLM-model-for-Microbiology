## **Students can:**

1- Ask about syllabus content

2- Get explanations for syllabus topics

3- Access resources (e.g., books, videos, research papers)

4- Learn from questions and answers shared by previous students


### Introduction

Using LangChain, we are building an LLM-powered assistant for the university's microbiology department to support professors in their research and students in their learning. The assistant enables intelligent querying and summarization of scientific literature, lab protocols, microbiological datasets, and syllabus content. Students can use the assistant to explore topics, access curated resources (books, videos, papers), receive personalized study plans, and learn from cumulative questions and answers shared by students from previous years."
