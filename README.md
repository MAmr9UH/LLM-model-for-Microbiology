# LLM-model-for-Microbiology

Using LangChain, we are building an LLM-powered assistant for the university's microbiology department to support professors in their research and students in their education. The assistant enables intelligent querying and summarization of scientific literature, lab protocols, microbiological data, and syllabus-based cumulative questions from previous years, as submitted by students.





Students can:

Ask about syllabus content

Get explanations for syllabus topics

Access resources (e.g., books, videos, research papers)

Learn from questions and answers shared by previous students
